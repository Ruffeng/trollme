# Trollme
How many of us we work in an office, and spend 8 daily hours with our colleagues? How many time did we see their screens unlocked, tempted to apply some changes on their laptops?

That's the purpose of **Trollme**. Basically is a gem to prank people changing their Desktop Background. Right now is a super small version, so it just changes to a single picture of Carmen de Mairena, a famous celebrity from Spain. In the next version, it will support different topics and images.

As well is important to say that right now it just works with Mac. I know it's not 100% fair that it's just supported by one OS. But 90% of my colleagues are working with Mac and the idea of this gem is to prank them... In the future, I can try to arrange it.
**Why do I want to do that?**

Just looking to prank some people in a funny and inoffensive way. At the end we teach them to lock their screens and help the enterprise to apply the ISO Quality Management, don't we?

## Installation
Is quite easy:

 ` gem install trollme`

Then in your command line terminal, you just have to invoke it
`$ trollme`

Or if you are a Rails developer and you want to super troll them, just hide it in your gemfile
`gem 'trollme'`
now just wait until they leave the screen unlocked and just run the command line statement. Cool :)
